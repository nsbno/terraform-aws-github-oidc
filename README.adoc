= OIDC Role for GitHub Actions
:source-highlighter: rouge

A module to help you configure an OIDC role to use with GitHub Actions. The role allows GitHub actions to perform the following in the same AWS account as the role:

* Read from S3 buckets
* Write to S3 buckets
* Publish Docker images to ECR
* Update ECS services

NOTE: Using this module to update/deploy ECS services from GitHub Actions should only be used in test/staging environments. It is not recommended to use this in production environments.

module "oidc_role" {
  source = "github.com/nsbno/terraform-aws-github-oidc?ref=x.y.z"

  allowed_s3_write_arns = [
